# Project‑Choose‑Your‑Adventure  

A simple, text‑based “Choose Your Own Adventure” game in Python.  

## Overview  
Project‑Choose‑Your‑Adventure is a console‑based interactive story engine implemented in Python.  
Players make choices by inputting commands or selections, and the story branches depending on their decisions.  
This is a fun, educational project — a starting point for learning Python, branching logic, and simple game design.  

## Features  
- Branching storyline — choices lead to different paths and endings.  
- Modular design — each story (or chapter) can be defined in its own Python file (e.g., `story1.py`, `story2.py`).  
- Easy to extend — you can add new story files or paths without changing the core logic.  
- Pure Python — no extra dependencies, works out-of-the-box with a standard Python installation.
